This is my portion of the code from a team project that scrapes company information off Glassdoors. However, it works independently.

In order to use this code, make sure to input your Glassdoor username and password in the "secret.json" file, then run the Jupyter notebook.

Scraping Glassdoor - Tina (Companies in California).ipynb logs into Glassdoor to scrape the information.
Visualizing Glassdoor - Tina (Companies in California).ipynb takes the scraped data and creates charts.

In case of error, make sure your Google Chrome version matches the chromedriver.exe version, otherwise install the correct driver provided from the link in the error thrown.
